#Coding Project Assignment: Contact Manager

#Overview
#You are tasked with developing a contact manager application that uses dictionaries and sets to store and manage contacts. The application should also provide functionality to serialize the contact data for storage and retrieval.

#Objectives
#Contact Class: Create a class named Contact with the following attributes:

#- name (string)
#- email (string)
#- phone (string)
#- tags (set of strings) - to categorize the contact (e.g., "family", "work").


#Serialization: Implement methods within the Contact class to serialize and deserialize a Contact object to and from a JSON string.

#Contact Manager Class: Create a ContactManager class which manages a collection of contacts. Use a dictionary to store contacts, where the key is the contact's email and the value is the Contact object.

#Functionality: The ContactManager should provide methods to:

#- Add a new contact
#- Remove a contact by email
#- Retrieve a contact by email
#- Retrieve contacts by a tag
#- Save all contacts to a file in a serialized format (JSON)
#- Load contacts from a file
#- Error Handling: Ensure that your program handles cases such as adding a contact with an existing email or retrieving a contact/tag that does not exist.

#Tag Management: Provide a method in the Contact class to add or remove tags from a contact.

#Testing with Pytest
#Your submission must pass the following tests:

#- Test creation of a Contact object and ensure that its attributes are correctly assigned.
#- Test serialization and deserialization of a Contact object.
#- Test adding, removing, and retrieving contacts in the ContactManager.
#- Test adding, removing, and retrieving tags from a contact.
#- Test saving to a file and loading from a file.
#- Test error handling and edge cases, such as adding a duplicate contact or retrieving a non-existent contact.

#Submission
#Submit your Python code with classes and methods fulfilling the above requirements. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows Python best practices. Include your Pytest test suite in your submission.
